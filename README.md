# Solitaire_Cipher

The Solitaire cryptographic algorithm was designed by Bruce Schneier at the request of Neal Stephenson for use in his novel Cryptonomicon, in which field agents use it to communicate securely without having to rely on electronics or having to carry incriminating tools. It was designed to be a manual cryptosystem calculated with an ordinary deck of playing cards. 

The cards are labelled 1-54 where 53 and 54 are jokers. In the future, I will implement the ascii art of the cards to visualise the keystream. For now, the keystream is stored in a file which is also an arguement for the binary file created by the C++ program.

Vulnerabilities and reasons : 

1.    Lack of Formal Analysis: The Solitaire cipher has not undergone the rigorous cryptographic analysis that real-world encryption algorithms like AES or RSA have. Without such analysis, it's challenging to determine its security properties accurately.

2.   Small Key Space: The Solitaire cipher uses a deck of playing cards to generate a key stream. The number of possible initial deck configurations is limited by the number of unique ways you can arrange a deck of cards, making the key space relatively small compared to modern encryption standards.

3.    Lack of Diffusion: Effective encryption algorithms should ensure that small changes in the plaintext result in significantly different ciphertexts. Solitaire may not exhibit strong diffusion properties, making it potentially vulnerable to various cryptanalytic attacks.

4.    No Public Review: Real encryption algorithms benefit from extensive public scrutiny and peer review, which helps identify and address potential vulnerabilities. The Solitaire cipher does not have the benefit of this kind of review.

5.    Simplicity: The Solitaire cipher is intentionally simple to be easily understood within the context of a novel. This simplicity can make it more susceptible to attacks that exploit its underlying structure.

6.    Lack of Modern Features: Modern encryption algorithms incorporate various features like key management, authentication, and integrity checking, which are crucial for securing data in real-world applications. Solitaire lacks these features.
