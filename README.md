# Solitaire_Cipher

The Solitaire cryptographic algorithm was designed by Bruce Schneier at the request of Neal Stephenson for use in his novel Cryptonomicon, in which field agents use it to communicate securely without having to rely on electronics or having to carry incriminating tools. It was designed to be a manual cryptosystem calculated with an ordinary deck of playing cards. 

The cards are labelled 1-54 where 53 and 54 are jokers. In the future, I will implement the ascii art of the cards to visualise the keystream. For now, the keystream is stored in a file which is also an arguement for the binary file created by the C++ program.
